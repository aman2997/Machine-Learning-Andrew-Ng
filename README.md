# Machine-Learning-Andrew-Ng
Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course

My codes for the Machine Learning course. Hope this will prove to be helpful for all of you. Please try to solve the exercises on your own. These are only to clear some doubts and not to copy whole code. Remember that you have enrolled to learn.

Add the data, weights, token and submit files to run completely.

Thanks for stopping by! :)
